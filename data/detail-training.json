The program helps you assess the security posture of an organization by identifying vulnerabilities in the network and system infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible. The Certified Ethical Hacker program is the most comprehensive Ethical Hacking program in the world. It is the first of three programs within our Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) track. This program will upskill you on the most advanced tools and techniques used by black and grey hat hackers alike to break into an organization to assess, document, and remediate vulnerabilities from a vendor neutral perspective. CEH will put you in the driver’s seat of an interactive, hand’s-on learning environment that challenges you to test the integrity of systems and networks by hacking them!",

Computer crime in today’s cyber world is on the rise. Computer Investigation techniques are being used by police, government, and corporate entities globally and many of them turn to EC-Council for our Digital Forensic Investigator CHFI Certification Program. Computer Security and Computer investigations are changing terms. More tools are invented daily for conducting Computer Investigations, be it computer crime, digital forensics, computer investigations, or even standard computer data recovery. The tools and techniques covered in EC-Council’s CHFI program will prepare the student to conduct computer investigations using ground-breaking digital forensics technologies. Computer forensics is simply the application of computer investigation and analysis techniques in the interests of determining potential legal evidence. Evidence might be sought in a wide range of computer crime or misuse, including but not limited to theft of trade secrets, theft of or destruction of intellectual property, and fraud. CHFI investigators can draw on an array of methods for discovering data that resides in a computer system, or recovering deleted, encrypted, or damaged file information known as computer data recovery.",

Along with big data, data mining, predictive analytics, data science, and data stewards, BI is now very much part of business vocabulary. Much of the impetus behind this is the need for organizations to cope with ever-increasing datasets. It is now normal to have databases that contain millions of rows, requiring gigabytes, terabytes, or even petabytes, of storage space. Data is no longer confined to an on-premises server room—it is hosted in the cloud, feeds are taken from third-party providers, public datasets are freely available, and social media interactions generate ever-expanding datasets. Reporting and analysis is certainly not a new concept to business, but the difference between how data analysis is done today, compared with five or 10 years ago, is immense. Nowadays, organizations need BI to see not only what was done in the past, but also more of what is to come. There is now an overwhelming amount of data to gather and compose into reports. There is also an increasing need for data to offer up-to-the-minute numbers, so business can react faster to changing trends in markets and industries. Those businesses that can react fast and predict near-term trends to provide products and services where there is consumer demand have the best chance of survival in our modern and highly competitive world. With the rise of big data, there is an increasing need for data analysts who can take this data, and find the critical points within a plethora of information."

The Self-Service BI trend is driven by Microsoft's commitment to improving Excel and Power BI, both products having seen many enhancements over recent years. However, despite Microsoft enabling deeper data analysis with the four power tools added to Excel—Power Pivot, Power View, Power Query, and Power Map—they are not fully integrated into the Excel interface. Instead, they exist in separate windows. Add to this the complexity of publishing to SharePoint to share reports with colleagues, and it all becomes a time-consuming effort. Using Power BI eliminates complications and barriers with a simple integrated user interface, and has the ability to publish rapidly to either a cloud-based or an on-premise portal to share reports easily. This module introduces Power BI, and explores the features that enable the rapid creation and publication of sophisticated data visualizations."

Microsoft Excel has long been the tool of choice for data analysts who work in a self-service style. However, Excel does not offer a quick and easy way to share reports without the use of either SharePoint, or the creation of multiple copies of spreadsheets that quickly become out of date, or exist outside source control. In recent years, power tools have been added to Excel: Power View, Power Query (known as Get & Transform in Excel 2016), and Power Pivot. Power BI brings much of this power into an integrated environment in the form of Power BI Desktop. Previously, Excel users have been inconvenienced by needing to transition between the different power tools, but Power BI Desktop brings the tools together. This means that Power BI is fast becoming an obvious choice for the analysis and sharing of data. However, analysts are likely to continue working with Excel for the foreseeable future. Power BI easily cooperates with Excel, and many other data sources. It’s this ability to create reports rapidly, by using data from a combination of sources, that really puts the power into Power BI."

Users can connect to a wide variety of data sources, combining data from on-premises databases, Software as a Solution (SaaS) providers, cloud-based services, and local files such as Microsoft Excel, into one report. The beauty of Power BI reports and dashboards is the ability to rapidly build reports to present this data so it is instantly readable—with clusters, outliers, and patterns in data visually brought to light. To achieve this, each report must have a dataset comprising tables and columns that are ready to add straight into visualizations. Data must be formatted for relevant currencies, numbers should have correct decimal places, additional columns and measures might be required, and data may have to be combined from multiple tables. With Power BI Desktop, you can do all of this, with powerful, built-in tools for shaping your data. This module introduces the tools that are available for preparing your data, and transforming it into a form ready for reporting."

Power BI works with SQL Server Analysis Services models that are running in multidimensional mode, so that you can use OLAP cubes and models in reports and dashboards.

Power BI reports and dashboards are designed to work on a mobile device without modification. However, you can also create specific optimized reports and report layouts for display on mobile devices.
